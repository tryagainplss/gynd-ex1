# Snowflake Workshop: Advanced Data Engineering
## 3-Hour Virtual Workshop for Telco Data Team

### Workshop Overview
- **Duration**: 3 hours
- **Format**: Virtual interactive session
- **Audience**: 30-person data team (junior to senior data engineers and analysts)
- **Prerequisites**: Basic SQL knowledge, familiarity with data warehousing concepts

---

## Session 1: Views & Performance (60 minutes)

### Introduction to Snowflake Views
• **What are Views in Snowflake?**
  - Virtual tables based on SQL queries
  - No physical storage of data
  - Always reflect current data from underlying tables

• **Types of Views**
  - **Regular Views**: Standard SQL views
  - **Materialized Views**: Pre-computed results stored physically
  - **Secure Views**: Enhanced security with row-level access control

### Performance Optimization with Views
• **When to Use Regular Views**
  - Complex queries that are frequently used
  - Data abstraction and simplification
  - Security and access control

• **When to Use Materialized Views**
  - Expensive aggregations and joins
  - Frequently accessed data that doesn't change often
  - Performance-critical reporting queries

• **View Performance Best Practices**
  - Query optimization techniques
  - Clustering strategies for views
  - Monitoring view performance

### Hands-on Exercises
• **Exercise 1**: Creating and using regular views
• **Exercise 2**: Building materialized views for performance
• **Exercise 3**: Comparing performance between view types
• **Exercise 4**: Advanced view optimization techniques

## Session 2: Time Travel & Fail-safe (60 minutes)

### Understanding Data Protection in Snowflake
• **What is Time Travel?**
  - Point-in-time data recovery
  - Historical data access without backups
  - Configurable retention periods (0-90 days)

• **Fail-safe Protection**
  - Additional 7-day protection after Time Travel expires
  - Automatic disaster recovery
  - No additional cost or configuration required

### Time Travel Features
• **Time Travel Operations**
  - Querying historical data
  - Cloning tables at specific points in time
  - Restoring dropped objects
  - Undoing accidental changes

• **Practical Use Cases**
  - Data recovery scenarios
  - Audit trail analysis
  - Development and testing
  - Compliance requirements

### Hands-on Exercises
• **Exercise 1**: Basic Time Travel queries
• **Exercise 2**: Cloning tables at specific timestamps
• **Exercise 3**: Restoring dropped objects
• **Exercise 4**: Real-world recovery scenarios

## Session 3: CDC with Streams & Tasks, Snowpipe (60 minutes)

### Change Data Capture (CDC) with Streams
• **What are Streams?**
  - Change tracking mechanism
  - Real-time data change detection
  - Support for INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE operations

• **Stream Types and Use Cases**
  - Standard streams for all changes
  - Append-only streams for INSERT operations
  - Insert-only streams for specific use cases

### Automated Processing with Tasks
• **Task Fundamentals**
  - Scheduled SQL execution
  - DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) support
  - Error handling and retry logic

• **Advanced Task Features**
  - Conditional execution
  - Task dependencies
  - Resource management

### Data Ingestion with Snowpipe
• **Snowpipe Overview**
  - Serverless data loading
  - Continuous data ingestion
  - Auto-scaling capabilities

• **Snowpipe Implementation**
  - File format configuration
  - Copy command optimization
  - Error handling and monitoring

### Hands-on Exercises
• **Exercise 1**: Creating and monitoring streams
• **Exercise 2**: Building automated data pipelines with tasks
• **Exercise 3**: Setting up Snowpipe for continuous ingestion
• **Exercise 4**: End-to-end CDC pipeline implementation
