- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Pre-written exercises with telco-specific examples
- **Sample Data**: Telco-specific datasets for realistic scenarios

### Knowledge Prerequisites
- Basic SQL knowledge
- Familiarity with data warehousing concepts
- Understanding of ETL/ELT processes (for Session 3)

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Snowflake Account Setup
```sql
-- Create workshop database and schemas
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS TELCO_WORKSHOP;
USE DATABASE TELCO_WORKSHOP;

-- Create schemas for each session
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS VIEWS_DEMO;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS TIME_TRAVEL_DEMO;
CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS CDC_DEMO;
```

### 2. Warehouse Configuration
```sql
-- Ensure appropriate warehouse is available
CREATE WAREHOUSE IF NOT EXISTS COMPUTE_WH
WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'X-SMALL'
AUTO_SUSPEND = 60
AUTO_RESUME = TRUE;
```

### 3. User Permissions
Ensure participants have the following permissions:
- `USAGE` on database and schemas
- `CREATE` on tables, views, streams, tasks, pipes
- `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, `SELECT` on workshop objects
- `USAGE` on warehouse

## Workshop Execution

### Session Flow (Each 60-minute session)
1. **10 minutes**: Topic introduction and concepts
2. **40 minutes**: Hands-on exercises and demonstrations
3. **10 minutes**: Q&A and best practices discussion

### Running the Notebooks
1. Open each notebook in Snowflake's native notebook interface
2. Execute cells sequentially from top to bottom
3. Follow the comments and explanations in each cell
4. Complete all exercises before moving to the next session

### Sample Data
Each notebook creates its own sample telco data including:
- Customer information (ID, name, phone, plan type, billing)
- Usage data (data consumption, minutes, texts, costs)
- Billing information (charges, payments, status)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

### Views & Performance
- Create and optimize regular and materialized views
- Compare performance between different view types
- Apply view optimization techniques to real-world scenarios
- Implement secure views for data protection

### Time Travel & Fail-safe
- Use Time Travel for point-in-time data recovery
- Clone tables at specific timestamps
- Restore accidentally dropped objects
- Implement data recovery strategies
- Understand automatic Fail-safe protection

### CDC with Streams & Tasks, Snowpipe
- Create and monitor streams for change detection
- Build automated data pipelines with tasks
- Set up continuous data ingestion with Snowpipe
- Implement end-to-end CDC pipelines
- Monitor and troubleshoot pipeline health

## Real-World Applications

### Telco-Specific Use Cases
- **Customer Churn Analysis**: Using views to identify at-risk customers
- **Revenue Optimization**: Materialized views for billing analysis
- **Data Recovery**: Time Travel for billing dispute resolution
- **Real-time Monitoring**: CDC pipelines for usage tracking
- **Compliance Reporting**: Historical data analysis for regulatory requirements

### Business Impact
- **Performance**: Optimized queries and views for faster reporting
- **Reliability**: Data protection and recovery capabilities
